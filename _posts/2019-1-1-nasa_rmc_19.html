        Our 2018-2019 robot, Glennelope, featured iterative improvements on past designs and our closest bid at full autonomy to date. At competition this year, we were awarded 4th place for autonomy, being able to traverse the obstacle field and into the digging zone autonomously. Additionally, we won 3rd place in the mining category for amount of gravel collected. Finally, in the virtual competition held by NASA, we placed 3rd in the Systems Engineering Paper category.
