        Each year, the Micromouse team aims to construct a fully-autonomous maze solving robot. The goal of the competition is to not only make it to the center of the 10-by-10 maze, but to also be the fastest one to get there. Last year's robot featured six lidar ranging sensors, a Teensy microcontroller, and an A* maze solving algorithm. Although they did not place last year in the National Robotics Challenge competition, they will be back with plans for success this year.
