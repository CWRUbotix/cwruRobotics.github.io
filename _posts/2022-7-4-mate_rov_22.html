        This year CWRUbotix attended the 20th annual MATE World Championship at Long Beach City College in Long Beach, California with our ROV “CWRUstacean”. This was the second year that we have competed in this competition in person, the first having been in 2019. This year’s three-day competition was focused on themes such as ocean exploration, maintaining offshore wind turbines, and aquaculture.

        After a year's worth of hard work from our team, we are pleased to have placed 2nd in both the Product Demonstration and Technical Documentation categories, as well as 5th overall out of 20 teams from across the globe. We would like to thank their sponsors, especially the Case Alumni Association. Following this year's success, we are excited to innovate and return to compete in 2023.
