        This year, our Micromouse team went above and beyond, receiving the Gold Award and the Honda Innovation Award at NRC's Micromouse competition! Some changes to this year's robot include removing the gyroscope and ultrasonic sensors in favor of long range lidar sensors. Additionally, the robot uses a flood fill maze solving algorithm rather than the A* algorithm the team had used in previous years. Incredibly, this robot is nearly half the size of last year's, and the Micromouse team is planning on shrinking the design even more next year!
