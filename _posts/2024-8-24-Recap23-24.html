    This year was a massive success for CWRUbotix! We competed in NRC’s Micromouse competition as well as MATE II’s World Championship. Below are updates from each of our competition teams.

    Our Micromouse team won the Gold Award at NRC’s Micromouse competition! Their design was so impressive that they were awarded the Honda Innovation award as well. This year they plan to make the robot even smaller and optimize its movement.

    Our MATE ROV team placed in 5th at MATE II’s ROV World Championship, this year in Kingsport, Tennessee. They were less than 10 points away from the top 3, out of 750 points total. This year, the team has several ideas for improving the robot and scoring more points, with the goal to place in the top 3 next competition.
