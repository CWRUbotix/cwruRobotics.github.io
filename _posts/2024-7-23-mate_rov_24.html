        CWRUbotix deployed “Scuba Dooba Tuba: Electric Beluga” at the 22nd annual MATE World Championship in Kingsport, Tennessee. It was designed to tackle challenges related to ocean observation and protecting ocean biodiversity. This year, we placed in 5th out of the 29 Explorer teams competing!

        Some new features of “Scuba Dooba” include latches for quick access to the electronics bay, a rotating manipulator designed to turn a valve, and two industrial ethernet cameras from Teledyne FLIR. We would like to shout out our sponsors for their generous support, which allowed us to implement these features this year. Thank you!

        We had a lot of fun with the design for “Scuba Dooba,” with the colors and thruster guards inspired by the mystery machine from Scooby Doo and googly eyes for added personality.
