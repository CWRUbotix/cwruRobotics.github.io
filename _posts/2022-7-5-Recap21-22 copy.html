    After many online competitions due to COVID-19, CWRUbotix is happy to have participated in many in-person competitions during our 2021-2022 competition year! Our MATE ROV team as well as our two NRC teams had a blast competing in their respective competitions. Below we have a short overview of each competition team and their accomplishments from this year.

This year, the 20th annual MATE ROV World Championship took place in Long Beach City College in Long Beach, California, just over 2,000 miles from our home base in Cleveland! We are happy to announce that we placed 5th overall in the Explorer division with our ROV “CWRUstacean”. Additionally, we placed 2nd in the Technical Documentation and Product Demonstration categories.
