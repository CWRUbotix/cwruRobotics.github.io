        The Fish, a 3-pounder, competed at NRC in 2016. It won the bronze medal and was the only combat nominee for the Honda Innovation Award. The Fish was built by Michael Schaffer, Hanyu Zhang, Johanna Fritzinger, Jonathan Mertz, George Hernandez, and Ailin Yu. It was laid to rest in the display cabinets on the third floor of Glennan.
