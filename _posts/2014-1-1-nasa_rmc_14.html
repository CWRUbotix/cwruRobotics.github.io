        For the 2013-2014 NASA RMC competition we decided to attempt a different type of excavation system. After researching different excavation methods we selected a bucket wheel excavator to collect and a conveyor belt to deposit the regolith. Notably the bucket wheel had custom 3D printed buckets designed to redirect regolith into the hopper. This robot also attempted to utilize four independently rotating wheel pods.
