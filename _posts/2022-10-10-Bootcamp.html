    This yearâ€™s bootcamp had two teams, red and blue, of 3 robots competing against each other for who would be the best pumpkin collectors! Each of the teams designed a robot to collect pumpkins- or keep other robots from collecting pumpkins- into their respective colored zones. The more pumpkins, the more points!
