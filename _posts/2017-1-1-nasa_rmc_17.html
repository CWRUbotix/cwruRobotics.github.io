        The 2016-2017 robot successfully competed at the 2017 NASA Robotic Mining Competition
        placing 5th Overall, capping off months of intensive work!

    <p class="text-block">
        Through a thorough and systematic engineering process, we applied lessons learned throughout the
        2015-2016 year in order to optimize the design for NASA's changed rules.
        Indeed, while it bears external similarities to the previous year's robot, 'Glennifer' is the confluence of
        iterations on concepts subteams felt worked well, and new approaches chosen by data-driven analysis.
