        This yearâ€™s combat robot was a full body spinner that consisted of a flexible 3D printed chaise with a three omni wheel drivetrain. Our weapon was a beyblade inspired aluminum ring around the robot that was attached to the frame with a polycarbonate wheel on the top. This year's team placed within the top 8 teams within the NRC combat post-secondary division!
