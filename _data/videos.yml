- title: CWRUbotix Hardware Lecture - Op-Amps & Comparators
  description: In this lecture, Adam covers the basics of Op-Amps and Comparators. He starts with the fundamental behavior of op-amps and the basic assumptions we make about their operation. Next he discusses the importance of negative feedback in constructing op-amp circuits and dives into fundamental op-amp circuit topologies. Adam ends with talking about comparators and introduces the concept of positive feedback and hysteresis.
