        The National Robotcs Challenge (NRC) is a collection of robotics competitions rolled into one large event. Held nearby in Marion, Ohio in the beginning of April, the competitions are open to students from 6th grade through graduate school. Competitions range from combat robots to pick and place machines to hockey playing robots. Currently, we participate in the Combat and Micromouse competitions.
