    <h2>Girl Scout & Cub Scout Workshops</h2>
    <p>
        We are proud to have helped many Girl Scout and Cub Scout troops from Northeastern Ohio learn many integral skills to engineering and computer science. From understanding binary to designing robots of their own, CWRUbotix has hosted many different groups of all ages.
